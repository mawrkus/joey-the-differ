# Joey the Differ

JSON diffing on steroids.

## ðŸ§¬ Installation

```shell
npm install joey-the-differ
```

## ðŸ§¬ Usage

### Command line

```text
Usage: joey-the-differ [options]

Options:
  -V, --version        output the version number
  -s, --source [file]  source file or directory, required
  -t, --target [file]  target file or directory, required
  -o, --output [file]  output file or directory, optional
  -c, --config [file]  config file (JS), optional
  -v, --verbose        verbose mode, optional
  -h, --help           display help for command
```

For instance, using [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx):

```shell
npx joey-the-differ -s demo/source.json -t demo/target.json -c demo/options.js
```

or using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker):

```shell
docker build . -t mawrkus/joey-the-differ
docker run -v ${PWD}:/tmp mawrkus/joey-the-differ -s /tmp/demo/source.json -t /tmp/demo/target.json -c /tmp/demo/options.js
```

Have a look at the [demo folder](./demo) to see the content of the files.

#### Bulk diffing

You can diff one `source` file against many, if `target` is a directory:

```shell
npx joey-the-differ -s demo/bulk/sources/1.json -t demo/bulk/targets -c demo/options.js
```

or many files against one `target` file, if `source` is a directory:

```shell
npx joey-the-differ -s demo/bulk/sources -t demo/bulk/targets/1.json -c demo/options.js
```

or you can diff matching pairs of files if `source` and `target` are directories:

```shell
npx joey-the-differ -s demo/bulk/sources -t demo/bulk/targets -c demo/options.js
```

In this case, the files with the same name in both `source` and `target` directories will be diffed.

`output` can be either a file or a directory. In case of a directory, for each file matched, a file with the same name will be created.

## ðŸ§¬ API

### constructor options

| Name  | Type  | Default | Description | Example |
| ---   | ---   | ---     | ---         | ---     |
| `allowNewTargetProperties` | Boolean | false | To allow or not diffing properties that exist in `target` but not in `source` | |
| `blacklist` | String[] | [] | An array of regular expressions used to match specific properties identified by their path | `'genres\\.(\\d+)\\.booksCount'` will prevent diffing the `booksCount` property of all the `genres` array elements (objects) |
| `preprocessors` | Object | {} | Preprocessors, associating a regular expression to a transform function  | See "Usage" above |
| `differs` | Object | {} | Custom differs, associating a regular expression to a diffing function  | See "Usage" above |

### diff(source, target)

Compares `source` to `target` by recursively visiting all `source` properties and diffing them with the corresponding properties in `target`.

If a `blacklist` option is passed, it is used to prevent diffing specific properties identified by their path, in `source` and in `target`.

If `allowNewTargetProperties` is set to `true`, the properties that exist in `target` but not in `source` won't appear in the changes.

If custom differs are passed, they are used to compare the `source` and `target` properties matched by the regular expressions provided.

If preprocessors are passed, they act prior to diffing, to transform the `source` and `target` values matched by the regular expressions provided.

All JSON primitive values will be compared using strict equality (`===`).

```js
const changes = joey.diff(source, target);
```

`changes` is an array of differences where each element is like:

```js
{
  path: 'path.to.value',
  source: 'source value',
  target: 'target value',
  meta: {
    op: 'the operation that happened on the value: add, remove, or replace',
    reason: 'an explanation of why the source and target values are not equal',
    preprocessor: {
      source: 'source value after preprocessing',
      target: 'target value after preprocessing',
    },
    // ...
    // and any other value returned by your custom differs or by Joey in the future
  },
}
```

### async diffFiles(sourcePath, targetPath, optionalOutputPath)

```js
const results = await joey.diffFiles(sourcePath, targetPath, optionalOutputPath);
```

`results` is an array of objects like:

```js
[
  {
    source: 'path to the source file',
    target: 'path to the target file',
    changes: [
      // see above
    ],
  },
  {
    // ...
  },
]
```

You can diff:

- one `source` file against many, if `target` is a directory
- many source files against one `target`, if `source` is a directory
- matching pairs of files if `source` and `target` are directories (the files with the same names in both `source` and `target` will be diffed)

`optionalOutputPath` can be either a file or a directory. In case of a directory, for each file matched, a file with the same name will be created. For diffing one file against one file, it must be a file.
