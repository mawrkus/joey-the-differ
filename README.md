## ðŸ§¬ API

### constructor options

| Name  | Type  | Default | Description | Example |
| ---   | ---   | ---     | ---         | ---     |
| `blacklist` | String[] | [] | An array of regular expressions used to match specific `source` properties identified by their path | `'genres\\.(\\d+)\\.booksCount'` will prevent diffing the `booksCount` property of all the `genres` array elements (objects) |
| `allowNewTargetProperties` | Boolean | false | To allow or not diffing properties that exist in `target` but not in `source` | |
| `differs` | Object | {} | Custom differs, associating a regular expression to a diffing function  | See "Usage" above |

### diff(source, target)

Compares `source` to `target` by recursively visiting all `source` properties and diffing them with the corresponding properties in `target`. If a `blacklist` option was passed, the regular expressions are used to prevent diffing specific `source` properties identified by their path.

If `allowNewTargetProperties` was set to `true`, properties that exist in `target` but not in `source`will not appear in the results.

If custom differs were passed, they will be used to compare the `source` and `target` properties matched by the regular expressions provided.

All JSON primitive values will be compared using strict equality (`===`).

```js
const results = joey.diff(source, target);
```

`results` is an array of differences where each element is like:

```js
{
  path: 'path.to.value',
  source: 'source value',
  target: 'target value',
  meta: {
    reason: 'an explanation of why the source and target values are not equal',
    // any other value returned by your custom differs or by Joey the Differ in the future
  },
}
```
